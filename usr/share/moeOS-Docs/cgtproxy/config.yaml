# `match` is an regex to match the cgroup path.
# `direct` means the traffic will not be redirect to any TPROXY server;
# `drop` means the traffic will be drop;
# `tproxy` means the traffic will be redirect to that TPROXY server.

# NOTE: You can use systemd-cgls to check the cgroup layout on your system.

# NOTE: Any web service will provide their service directly.
#       Traffics in connection created by remote host
#       will never redirect to TPROXY server or drop.

  # This rule match the clash-meta core.
